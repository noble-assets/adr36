# ADR36
ADR36 is a standard within the Cosmos ecosystem that handles the signing of arbitrary data for Cosmos SDK-based chains. It enables users to authenticate and authorize actions by signing messages off-chain using their private keys. The signed messages can be verified on-chain or off-chain, ensuring that actions are genuinely initiated by the holder.
