[ADR36] is a standard within the Cosmos ecosystem that defines the structure of
signing arbitrary data for Cosmos SDK-based chains. It enables users to
authenticate and authorize actions by signing messages off-chain using their
private keys. The signed messages can be verified on-chain or off-chain,
ensuring that actions are genuinely initiated by the holder.
